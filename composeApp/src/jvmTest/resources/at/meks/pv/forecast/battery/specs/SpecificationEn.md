# Battery-Forecast

The application enables photovoltaic system owners to calculate—based on historical energy data, ideally in 15‑minute intervals—what the situation would have been with a battery storage system.

It calculates how much

* self‑produced energy would have been stored in the battery
* self‑produced energy would have been drawn from the battery
* money would have been saved in one year with the battery

To perform these calculations, you need to provide the application's energy data. Ideally, these are available in 15‑minute intervals; otherwise, the result can be very inaccurate.
